# Movie API
## RESTful Express API

This project demonstrates a REST API.

Start with

```
npm run start
```

## Data model
The API serves two resources:

+ movies
+ reviews

These are represented internally using SQL tables:
+ Movies(id, title, year)
+ Reviews(????)



### Bonus
Horizontal scaling - improve speed by adding another server for the database

Vertical scaling - improve speed by upgrading the database server
